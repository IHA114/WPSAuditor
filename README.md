I've written this project in 2016 <br>
The goal of this project is testing WPS enabled devices against some WPS Algorithms to check device security <br>

# Currently Supported Algorithms
* Generic
* D-Link
* ArrisDG860A
* TrendNet
* Arcadyan

# Note
most of these algorithms were found by Reverse Engineering
